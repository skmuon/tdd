# Chapter 1 - The Design Question

> [New ideas would come about] by connexion and transferring of the observations of one Arte, to the uses of another, when the experience of several misteries shall fall under considerations of one mans minde.
> - Sir Francis Bacon

## What is Design?

> To form a plan or scheme of, to arrange or conceive in the mind... 
> for later execution
> - Oxford English Dictionary

Dorothy Sayers, in her book 'The Mind of the Maker' breaks the creative process in the following lines
The three parts are ideas, implementation and interaction

1. The forumulation of the conceptual constructs
2. Implementation in real media
3. Interactivity with users in real uses


> Everything has been composed, just not yet written down
> - Letter to Leopold Mozart

**The Phases of Idea, Implementation and Interaction operate recursively.
Imlementation creates space in which another design must be done**
