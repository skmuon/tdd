# Chapter 2 - The Rational Model

The model followed by engineers in desiging

## Goal
There is a primary goal or objective. 
> Example - "One wants to build a beach house to take advantage of wind and wave at an oceanfront lot"

## Desiderata
Primary goal has desiderata, or secondary objectives.
> Example - The beach house should be reinforced to withstand hurricane force winds; it should sleep and seat at table at least 14 people; it should exploit the stunning views

## Utility Function
Design is optimized according to some utility or goodness that weights the several desiderata as to their importance.
> Example - More window area is a desideratatum, something desired in house design. But the utility added by each extra square foot at window diminishes.
> The same is true for electrical outlets

## Constraints
Every design, every optimization is subject to constraints. Some of these are binary, either satisfied or not.
> Example - The house must be set back at least 10 feet from the lot's side lines

Others are more elastic, with steeply rising penalities as one approches a limit, such as schedule constraints.
Some constraints are are simple, others blithely conceal terrifying complexity


## Resource Allocations, Budgets and Crucial Budgets
Many constraints take the form of fixed resource to be allocated among design elements. The most common is a total cost of the building.

## Design Trees
In the ration design model, designer makes design decision. Then within the design space narrowed by that decision, he makes another.
At each node he could have taken one or more paths, so one can think of the process of design as the systematic exploration of a tree structured design space.

In this model design is conceptually very simple. One searches the tree structured design space, testing each option against the constraints for feasability and choosing so as to optimize the utility function.
